The pool SRs are subject to change depending on signups.
P.S. I recommend reading the entire doc in full if this is your first osu! tourney.</li></ul><h2 id=signup-procedures--eligibility>Signup Procedures & Eligibility</h2><p>Players sign up individually and then get randomly drafted onto a team. Tiers will be made based on global rank at registration deadline and announced shortly after (10-15 minutes after the deadline).</p><p>Based on the number of signups in WOC9&10, I expect 8 teams of 6-8 players each (48-64 individual signups). If more than 64 sign ups occur, I might decide to expand to 12 teams, expanding the tourney by 1 round.</p><p>All current UW students (<strong>EDIT: Includes Gr. 12s accepted into UW</strong>) & non-UW players of past WOCs can sign up.
All current UW students will also be allowed to bring in a “+1” (prom style) if someone wants to join who does not fall into one of the above 2 categories. However, understand that this does not mean the “+1” will be guaranteed on your team. They still enter the random draw like everyone else.</p><h2 id=scheduling-procedures>Scheduling Procedures</h2><p>The host will schedule the matches with start times <strong>between and including 4pm and 10pm EDT</strong>.</p><p>Considering the large number of players per team, <strong>assure you are available for a large portion of this time frame on Friday, Saturday & Sunday for each weekend of this tourney’s duration <em>before</em> you decide to sign up</strong>.</p><p>If a default scheduled time does not work for any member of a team, get your team’s captain to DM your opponent’s captain and attempt to find a different time that works with you two. In the case of an agreed reschedule, one of the 2 captains of the match must DM me a screenshot with enough of your conversation to prove that both teams of the match consent to the new date and time in the reschedule.</p><p>To keep the tourney on schedule, <strong>matches can only be rescheduled to the end of the Tuesday after that round’s weekend at latest</strong>.</p><h2 id=match-procedures>Match Procedures</h2><ul><li><strong>10-minute grace period</strong> (a team FFs if they do not show the minimum required number of players during the first 10 minutes of the match)</li><li>If a team shows they want to pick a warmup map, they will only have 20 seconds to pick their map. If nothing is picked in these 20 seconds, the match will proceed without the warmup getting played.</li><li><strong>2 Bans</strong> for every bracket stage round, Bans & picks both alternate.</li><li>Both <strong>captains !roll</strong>, higher roll gets to choose between choosing ban order or pick order then the lower roll chooses the remaining order
(Ex: If captain of Team 1 wins roll and chooses “pick second”, this implies that captain 2 can choose to either ban first or second)</li><li><strong>120 second timers on bans and picks</strong>. After a pick, players will have 60 seconds to get in the lobby and ready up. Once both teams are ready, “!mp start 5” will be entered by the referee (command which starts the beatmap in 5 seconds).</li><li>Each team may take <strong>a single 3-minute time out</strong> at any point of the match to go to the washroom, grab a drink or snack, rethink their strategy / extend their pick time, etc.</li><li>Each player receives <strong>1 single disconnect allowance per match</strong> if they get disconnected within the first 30 seconds of a map where the map will be restarted. Any disconnects after the first 30 seconds will default a player’s score to the higher of 0 or whatever they left the lobby with unless they can provide screenshot evidence of a saved local score proving that they achieved a higher score.</li><li>If a ban timer runs out, the team will forfeit their ban. If the timer for a pick runs out, the pick is randomly rolled from the remaining non-TB maps.</li><li>At least 2 players per team must add mods for FM maps.</li><li>Possible mods on FM include HD, HR, EZ (1.8x multiplier) and FL (2.0x multiplier), EZFL (2.0x multiplier). Any combination of these mods is also allowed. The 2 players do not need to have unique mod combos (Ex. 2 people with HD each or 2 people with HR each is fine)</li></ul><h2 id=other-rules>Other Rules</h2><ul><li>Please remember to treat others with kindness and respect. This is especially important as we are trying out a randomized team format, where a lot of club members will be interacting with people they are not as familiar with.</li><li>If there are any rules I did not include or cover in this doc, let me know and I’ll decide on how to handle it and then record the way the situation was handled onto this document. That way, even if I missed something, the goal of being consistent with rules can remain.</li></ul><h2 id=prizing>Prizing</h2><p>Winning Team: 1 month of osu! Supporter per player</p><p>Prize pool may be increased either if donations are received, if sponsorship from past or future sponsors occurs or simply at host’s discretion.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
